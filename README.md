# AlienShooterGame
A basic 2-D alien shooter game that also has a small educational component. 

Once again, I wanted to apply my knowledge about JApplets, so I created a mini shooter style game where a person has to shoot the incoming aliens and also collect minerals to return back to safety. However, I also decided to add a minor educational component to the game so that it would not be purely about fighting and collecting.
